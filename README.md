# Starter Arduino Projects
A compilation of small beginner Arduino projects that aren't fancy enough to get a seperate repository. Most of them are just me playing around with different sensors and electrical components in order to advance my electronics skills.

All these designs are build for the **Arduino Uno R4 WiFi** board and mainly using _PlatformIO_. 



## Projects

The more detailed work descriptions can be found in seperate README files in every project folder.

### 3x "Hello World"

"Hello World" but 3 LEDs and a joystick, which lets me adjust their glowing brightness.
